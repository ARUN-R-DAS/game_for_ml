MAY 30 : made 2 sprites for player(Rabbit) and enemy (Hunter)
	The basic game idea is to make the Rabbit reach its burrow avoiding Hunter. Would be in top-down view
	Player can move in 4 directions, The Enemies have predefined patterns for moving. Attacks when collided
	Just keeping it simple, 2 bit black and white aesthetics.
